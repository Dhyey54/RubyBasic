# Ruby Basics

Learning and practicing basics of ruby

## Ruby OOPs Concept

Practiced Ruby OOPs concept.

### 1. Encapsulation

- Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
- Encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

Uses of Encapsulation

* Data Hiding
* Reusability
* Testing code is easy

### 2. Polymorphism

- Polymorphism is a method where one is able to execute the same method using different objects.
- In polymorphism, we can obtain different results using the same function by passing different input objects.

Polymorphism can be achieved through
* Polymorphism using Inheritance
* Polymorphism using Duck-Typing

### 3. Inheritance

- Inheritance allows the programmer to inherit the characteristics of one class into another class.
- Ruby supports single class inheritance and multi-level inheritance, it does not support multiple class inheritance but it can achieved through mixins.
- Inheritance provides the concept of “reusability”.

It has two type of classes
* Sub Class
* Super Class

### 4. Abstraction

- The idea of representing significant details and hiding details of functionality is called data abstraction.
- Abstraction is trying to minimize information so that the developer can concentrate on a few ideas at a time.

Uses of Abstraction

* It increases re-usability and prevents redundancy of code.
* Helps increase the security of a system
