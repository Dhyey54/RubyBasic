# Ruby Basics

Learning and practicing basics of ruby

## Ruby OOPs Concept

Practiced Ruby OOPs concept.

### Encapsulation

-Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
-Encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

* Data Hiding
* Reusability
* Testing code is easy

### Polymorphism

-Polymorphism is a method where one is able to execute the same method using different objects.
-In polymorphism, we can obtain different results using the same function by passing different input objects.

Polymorphism can be achieved through
* Polymorphism using Inheritance
* Polymorphism using Duck-Typing

### Inheritance

-Inheritance allows the programmer to inherit the characteristics of one class into another class.
-Ruby supports single class inheritance and multi-level inheritance, it does not support multiple class inheritance but it can achieved through mixins.
-Inheritance provides the concept of “reusability”.
